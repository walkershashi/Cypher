### Password Encrypter 

The package tells whether the password provided is strong or not and then encrypts the password.

#### Encryption.py 

This script encrypts the password provided and returns the encrypted password. The password is encrypted on the basis of a certain algorithm.

#### StrongPassword.py 

This script returns true if the password is strong and false is the password is weak.
The Password is considered to be strong if it consists:

<ul>
<li> Atleast one lowercase character: ['a-z'] </li>
<li> Atleast one uppercase character: ['A-Z'] </li>
<li> Atleast one digit: ['0-9'] </li>
